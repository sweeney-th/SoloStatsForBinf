## Sampling & Probability

```{R Random Sampling - No replacement}

# pick random from 5 in a range of 1-40
sample(1:40,5)
```

```{R Random Sampling - With Replacement}

# pick random from 5 in a range of 1-40
sample(c("Tails", "Heads"), 10, replace = TRUE)
```


```{R Random Sampling - With Replacement, Custom Odds}

# pick random from 5 in a range of 1-40
sample(c("Tails", "Heads"), 10, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.9, 0.1))
```


The ways of getting a given 5 number combination with no replacement:
```{R}

1/choose(40,5)
```

### Discrete Distributions

n and x are known as the binomial coefficients.

## Continuous Distributions 

### Definitions

    In order to model continuous data, we need to define random variables
    that can obtain the value of any real number. Because there are infinitely
    many numbers infinitely close, the probability of any particular value will
    be zero, so there is no such thing as a point probability as for discrete-
    valued random variables. Instead we have the concept of a density. This is
    the infinitesimal probability of hitting a small region around x divided by
    the size of the region. The cumulative distribution function can be defined
    as before, and we have the relation:

#### Uniform Distribution

    The uniform distribution has a constant density over a specified interval (by
    default [ 0, 1 ] ).
    
#### Normal Distribution

The normal distribution follows a bell curve, the exact shape of which depends on the mean and standard deviation.

### Distributions in R

    Four fundamental items can be calculated for a statistical distribution:
        • Density or point probability
        • Cumulated probability, distribution function
        • Quantiles
        • Pseudo-random numbers

R has a function for each of these. Usng the normal distribution as an example, there is *dnorm* for density, *pnorm* fo cumulative probability, *qnorm* for quantiles, and *rnorm* for random.


### Meaning of Density

        The density for a continuous distribution is a measure of the relative prob-
        ability of “getting a value close to x”. The probability of getting a value in
        a particular interval is the area under the corresponding part of the curve.
        
```{R Visualization of Normal Distribution}

curve(dnorm(x), from = -4, to = 4)
```

The vaule is continous and thus represented by the area under the curve. For discrete distributions, a histogram is more accurate:

```{R Binomial Histogram}

# sample size
x <- 0:50

# binomial with odds of .33/.66
plot(x, dbinom(x, size = 50, prob = 0.33), type = "h")
```


### Cumulitive Distribution Functions

These functions represent the chances of getting a value *or less* in the current distribution, for example, chances that x is 5 or lower. These are the functions in R that start with "p".

    Say that it is known that some biochemical measure in healthy individuals is well described by a normal distribution with a mean of 132 and a standard deviation of 13.

If a patient has a value of 160, what percent of the population has it?

```{R Patient Value}

# 100 minus the value of a 160 with given mean/sd
1 - pnorm(160, mean = 132, sd = 13)
```
